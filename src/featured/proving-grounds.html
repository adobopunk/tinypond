			Tiny Pond's design team revitalized the Proving Grounds brand,
			transforming the identity of the longstanding esports tournament
			host dedicated to nurturing emerging talent. Building on the
			original brand colors and logo, we crafted an edgy new asset
			package that fused streaks of color, a modern tech core, and
			bold, frenetic animations into an intense new identity that sets the
			tone for cutthroat competition.
