			<p>
				Tiny Pond is a creative duo created by Tifa Jade and Mateo
				Julia-Wise. We've spent years working side by side and
				refining our craft, while building a deep mutual respect.
			</p>
			<p>
				Together, we've collaborated on designs and animations for
				giants like Activision, Mountain Dew, Fortnite, Apex
				Legends, and Xbox, tag-teaming graphics and animation to
				deliver exceptional experiences with professionalism, care,
				and a shared passion for doing great work.

				The goal of Tiny Pond is simple: deliver great results,
				together. When you partner with us, you’re directly
				supporting independent artists, dedicated to creating
				exceptional bespoke work that sets you and your team up for
				success.
