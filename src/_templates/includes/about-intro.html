			<h1>What is Tiny Pond?</h1>

			<p>
				Tiny Pond is a creative studio and consultancy created by
				Tifa Jade and Mateo Julia-Wise. We worked side-by-side at
				BoomTV for over three years, collaborating on designs for
				gaming brands like Mountain Dew, Fortnite, and Xbox.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, we're excited to bring the same professionalism, care,
				and shared passion for design and animation that we brought
				to the biggest names in gaming, straight to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of Tiny Pond is simple: deliver great results,
				together. When you partner with us, you’re directly
				supporting independent artists, dedicated to creating
				exceptional bespoke design systems and assets that set you
				and your team up for success.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tiny Pond is a new venture for us, but our experience is
				vast, and the potential we bring is limitless. Let’s work
				together and make something amazing. We can't wait to
