			Tiny Pond's artists have had the exciting opportunity to
			collaborate with Epic Games throughout the years. When Fortnite
			brought back the original Battle Royale map, our team got to
			design a throwback tournament with $100,000 in prizing that saw
			many of the biggest Fortnite streamers come together to celebrate
			the return of the OG map.
