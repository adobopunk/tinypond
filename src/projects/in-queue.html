		<h2>Context</h2>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			The esports industry is at a crossroads. With corporate interests
			and profit-driven models dominating the tournament landscape, the
			soul of competition often takes a backseat.
		</p>
		<p>
			We founded In Queue to change that. Born from the collective
			passion of esports veterans, In Queue is an independent,
			worker-owned production and operations agency dedicated to
			authentic, community-driven competition.
		</p>
		<p>
			To stand out in a crowded space, we needed a brand identity as
			bold and uncompromising as our vision.

	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Most esports branding leans into aggressive, over-the-top
			aesthetics. In Queue needed something clean, confident, and
			iconic that would feel at home on a indie LAN stream or a
			championship trophy. We explored a wide range of directions
			before landing on a logo that felt iconic, ownable, and natural
			to animate.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final mark features four outward-facing arrows, symbolizing
			our core values: Integrity, Community, Opportunity, and
			Excellence. Its emblem-style silhouette fits naturally into the
			esports space while echoing the feeling of a game queue
			animation, a subtle nod built into the brandâ€™s DNA.

	<h2>Putting Values Front and Center</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			We knew that we wanted to launch In Queue with the promise that
			we're fighting to make competitive gaming more fun, more
			accessible, and uncompromised. Our announcement was accompanied
			by a brand video we built to gradually reveal the makeup of our
			logo, one element at a time, while also loudly announcing what we
			believe in, and why.
