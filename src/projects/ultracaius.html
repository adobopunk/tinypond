		UltraCaius hired Tiny Pond to build a new suite of visuals to coincide
		with the evolution of his VTuber model and a new era of streaming for
		the Kitsune of Eternal Blossom.
	</p>
	<p>
		We were delighted to collaborate on this project, which included
		social graphics, a cinematic animation, and a new set of streaming
		animations built from the ground up for the newly transformed
		UltraCaius.

	<h2>What We Did</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			We built a complete immersive streaming graphics package designed
			to transport UltraCaius's Twitch audience to a magical realm
			informed by the themes, styles, and character that make his
			community incredible. Taking direction from UltraCaius, we
			developed around themes he voiced interest in: celestial objects,
			torri gates, cherry blossoms, and general fantasy! âœ¨

		A fully-realized 3D animation to serve as a cinematic intermission
		screen.
	</p>
	<p>
		A complete set of bespoke animated streaming overlays with entrancing
		animations.
	</p>
	<p>Social banners, schedule assets, custom branding, and more.</p>

	<h2>Celestial Scene</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			UltraCaius's affinity for all things space resonated with us, and
			building a Makoto Shinkai-influenced night sky environment was a
			natural approach for UltraCaius's intermission cinematics. Built
			in Blender with heavy use of shader magic and geometry nodes,
			Tiny Pond built this cherry blossom scene with auroras, a comet,
			and rippling grass all themed around UltraCaius's color scheme
			and character themes.
