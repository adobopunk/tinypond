	<h2>Context</h2>

	<div>
		<p>
			Hot Burger was a live event hosted by Qtcinderella in Los
			Angeles, inspired by the chaotic fun of the Overcooked video
			game. Fans placed orders as if they were in the game, while
			Qtcinderella and her friends cooked and fulfilled them in real
			time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tiny Pond built an event identity that captured the playful,
			fast-paced energy of Overcooked while delivering a stylized,
			branded experience for both in-person attendees and online
			viewers.

	<h2>What We Did</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Taking inspiration from Overcooked, we provided creative
			direction from start to finish, developing a full suite of design
			assets to make Hot Burger a success.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="side-by-side center gap">
	<p class="">
		A bold, playful logo inspired by Overcooked, with tilted lettering,
		vibrant colors, and whimsical kitchen theme.
	</p>
	<p>
		Custom broadcast scenes including multi-scene split boxes, break
		screens, and lower thirds to keep the live stream fun and engaging.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eye-catching event signage, live order packaging, and more branded set
		dressing to enhance the on-site experience.

	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			We focused on capturing the chaotic yet fun spirit of Overcooked.
			We used a wood texture as a unifying theme to create a cozy,
			kitchen-like atmosphere.
		</p>
		<p>
			The branding was designed to adapt seamlessly across all event
			facets—broadcast graphics, signage, merchandise, and
			more—ensuring a consistent and immersive experience, delighting
			both in-person attendees and online viewers.

	<h2>Brand Extensions</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			To amplify the Hot Burger experience, we extended the brand into
			a range of merchandise and packaging that attendees could take
			home:
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="side-by-side center gap">
	<p class="">
		Playful, collectible stickers featuring the Hot Burger logo, perfect
		for fans to personalize their belongings and share their love for the
		event.
	</p>
	<p>
		Custom-designed aprons for Qtcinderella and her friends not only
		served a practical purpose but also became a memorable part of the
		event’s visual identity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Branded packaging for food orders and merchandise added a cohesive,
		professional touch to the event’s presentation.
