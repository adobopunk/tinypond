			When Rocket League debuted their collaboration with Porsche, Tiny
			Pond's art team got to team up with the automobile legend to
			produce a $50,000 tournament. Our artists designed the live
			broadcast, featured on the official Rocket League Twitch and
			social media channels.

				alt="Graphic showing the Porsche 911 Turbo Invitational logo with a blue Porsche 911 car on an orange background. 'In collaboration with Porsche.' Logo design section shows the evolution of logos from initial draft to final, reading 'Initial: letters communicate movement through change in font weight, but elements could complement each other better. Revised: more unison between elements. Logo in motion with wheel and speed lines is an improvement over the weight change. Final: prominent integration of 911 gives the logo a better sense of center.' Then a section features the glitch texture and orange gradient, reading 'Glitch Texture: Emphasizes the wacky and bombastic elements of Rocket League. Gradient: A sleek gradient with 2 sets of lines that mimic the Porsche 911 car."
