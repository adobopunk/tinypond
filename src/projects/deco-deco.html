			The team at Deco Deco approached Tiny Pond with a full service
			design proposal: for the grand opening of their new LA-based
			decoden space, they would need a full branding package, and a
			website that would both share key information with customers and
			capture their playful pastel aesthetic.
		</p>
		<p>
			We embraced the challenge and brought their vision to life,
			handling both branding and web design concurrently, and
			collaborating closely with the team to tailor every detail to
			their needs.

		<h2>Context</h2>
		<p class="">
			Deco Deco is a charming LA-based decoden studio giding customers
			through the process of designing and attaching decorative charms
			to a wide range of products. Decoden is a Japanese art form all
			about customizing accessories with unique, personalized
			aesthetics.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="project__context">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p class="">
			Build a website and comprehensive design package that includes a
			logo, color scheme, and overall branding. Deco Deco sought a
			website that would house all their products and business info
			while capturing a specific pastel-inspired, whimsical style.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="project__context">
		<h2>Strategy</h2>
		<p class="">
			By researching direct competitors alongside a general dive into
			decoden aesthetic, we would aim to capture the
			<i>kawaii</i> roots of the Japanese art with an LA twist. We
			would then translate our designs to a user-friendly website
			experience with products, information, and interactive
			reservations.

<h2>Branding Process</h2>
<p class="large">
	We crafted a playful, cutesy aesthetic that captures Deco Deco's welcoming
	and happy spirit.
</p>
<div>
	<p>
		Our branding process began with defining Deco Decoâ€™s playful identity.
		Our script-based logo, soft color palette, and retro patterns evoke a
		retro bakery aesthetic with a modern, grounded twist. Every design
		decision was aimed at building a brand that felt both approachable and
		magical.

<h2>Website Design</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
	<div>
		<p class="large">
			By building their web presence, we ensured Deco Deco could
			communicate key information with customers while demonstrating
			the fun, pastel aesthetic that defines their business's cheery
			commitment to a fun customer experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			With a need to show the store's product offerings, as well as
			allow the team to keep track of inventory, Shopify was our
			platform of choice. We heavily customized the platform's
			"Broadcast" theme to reflect Deco Deco's brand identity.
		</p>
		<p>
			We introduced visitors immediately to the Decoden concept with a
			simple three step graphic as the first stop on the home page,
			followed by a list of available accessories. We build an about
			page that integrated a Google Maps store locator, a reservations
			page that used Acuity to allow customers to reserve a time, and
			designed product pages that allowed for viewing color variations,
			pricing, and available inventory.
