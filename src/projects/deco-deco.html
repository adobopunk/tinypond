	<h2>Context</h2>

	<div>
		<p>
			Deco Deco is a Los Angeles-based arts & crafts studio
			specializing in Decoden, the Japanese art form that transforms
			everyday accessories into highly-customized personal treasures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our challenge was to create a visual identity from the ground up.
			We knew we wanted to Deco Deco’s playful and welcoming spirit,
			while appealing to a creative and charm-loving target audience.
		</p>

	<h2>What We Did</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			We developed a complete brand identity for Deco Deco, where every
			element was designed to capture Deco Deco’s happy, cutesy vibe
			and create a cohesive, magical experience for their customers.

		A custom logo featuring a soft script font for a handcrafted,
		personalized feel.
	</p>
	<p>
		A pastel color palette (light pink, peach, and cream) to evoke warmth
		and charm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hand-illustrated icons (hearts, flowers, and ribbons) and
		retro-inspired patterns for a whimsical, detail-oriented aesthetic.

	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Our process began with understanding and aligning our creative
			direction with Deco Deco’s essence. The brand needed to feel
			playful, feminine, and deeply creative.
		</p>
		<p>
			We explored mood boards, color palettes, and typography options
			to establish a direction that felt both whimsical and grounded.
			We helped Deco Deco apply the identity across their web design,
			storefront, and social media posts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The result is a brand identity that feels as unique and
			delightful as Deco Deco’s creations through a balanced blend of
			retro charm and modern appeal.
