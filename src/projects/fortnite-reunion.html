	<p>What's a reunion without a little cake?</p>
	<p class="small">
		To pull off a show-stopping announcement, we worked closely with the
		team at Epic Games to learn exactly which locations would return and
		featured them on a charming 3D cake. A system of over 30,000 particles
		brought our delicious design to life, with frosting drop trees and
		vibrant sprinkles rounding out the edible terrain.
