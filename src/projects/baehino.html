	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Baehino’s unique mix of cute and evil aesthetics informed every
			design choice, resulting in a striking color palette that was
			both inviting and mysterious. We leaned into fonts that fused
			sharp, angular lines with rounded edges—perfectly embodying
			Baehino’s "demon overlord" persona and her playful yet formidable
			character.
		</p>
		<p>
			We carried this vision throughout her Twitch profile and social
			media platforms, refreshing her profile panels with cohesive
			illustrations and icons. Eye-catching stream banners and social
			media graphics were all hand-crafted to reflect her brand’s
			personality, creating a seamless experience for her audience
			whether watching her streams or engaging with her content online.
