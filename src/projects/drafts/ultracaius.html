			elevate Baehino’s streaming experience. Every element was crafted
			to reflect Baehino’s persona as a demon overlord, creating a
			cohesive and immersive experience for her viewers.

		Looping, high-quality scenes optimized for 4+ hour streams, complete
		with a spooky scene transition, featuring hand-drawn animated elements
		to add dynamism and personality.
	</p>
	<p>
		Custom typography and a complete branding overhaul to define her
		unique visual language that blends cute and evil, in a flexible system
		that makes it easy to customize and create new scenes on the fly.

	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Baehino’s unique mix of cute and evil aesthetics informed every
			design choice, resulting in a striking color palette that was
			both inviting and mysterious. We leaned into fonts that fused
			sharp, angular lines with rounded edges—perfectly embodying
			Baehino’s "demon overlord" persona and her playful yet formidable
			character.
		</p>
		<p>
			We carried this vision throughout her Twitch profile and social
			media platforms, refreshing her profile panels with cohesive
			illustrations and icons. Eye-catching stream banners and social
			media graphics were all hand-crafted to reflect her brand’s
			personality, creating a seamless experience for her audience
			whether watching her streams or engaging with her content online.
