				Tiny Pond was born from a shared vision among three friends
				— Cory Sobon, Tifa Jade, and Mateo Julia-Wise. Having
				collaborated for nearly three years at BoomTV, we
				specialized in crafting high-profile esports events and
				working with leading gaming influencers in both pro and
				semi-pro competitive circuits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our collective efforts earned us the trust of major brands
				like Mountain Dew, Intel, Porsche, and Verizon, as well as
				renowned game publishers such as Epic Games, Xbox, and
				Activision. We've designed and produced memorable events for
				titles like Fortnite, Sea of Thieves, Halo, Call of Duty,
				and Apex Legends. From dynamic video announcements to
				striking broadcast graphics and seamless event management,
				our efforts and our craftsmanship consistently exceeded
				expectations.
			</p>
			<p>
				We knew that in order to further our creativity, innovation,
				and dedication, we'd need to take it on a new venture. Now,
				we're excited to bring that expertise to Tiny Pond and offer
				it to you directly.
			</p>
			<div class="divider"></div>
			<p>
				At Tiny Pond, we operate as a cooperative, focused on
				collaboration and mutual support. Everyone has an equal say
				in our operations, and we're each accountable for our own
				work. Without a traditional hierarchy of managers, or a CEO
				with shareholders to answer to, our goal is simply to
				produce great results. That means every dollar you invest in
				Tiny Pond directly supports our cause: making more awesome
				stuff, for you!
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s explore how Tiny Pond can bring your ideas to life. We
				can't wait to
				<a href="#contact">work with you.</a>

		<h1>Our Values</h1>
		<p>
			At Tiny Pond, our values guide every aspect of our work. These
			are our guiding stars - the principles that drive our passion and
			commitment to both our clients and our team. We’re not just about
			making ripples—we’re here to create waves of excellence.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="about__values-layout">
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Embrace Collaboration.</span>
				We believe that teamwork makes the dream work. Like frogs in
				a pond, we know that the best results come when we all leap
				together. Collaboration is our secret ingredient to keeping
				our ecosystem healthy.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Own Your Work.</span>
				Just like a frog’s leap, we take pride in our jumps — and
				we’re always ready to explain how we made it. Accountability
				means standing by our work and being transparent about our
				process. No need for lily pads to hide behind!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Happy People, Happy Frogs.</span>
				We’re all about people, not just pond life. Our strategies
				are designed to keep our clients and team at the center of
				our universe, because happy frogs and people make the best
				teams.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Think Global, Act Local.</span>
				With team members across the US, we use technology to keep
				us all on the same lily pad, making sure distance doesn’t
				slow us down. We embrace collaboration with groups of all
				scales and sizes, and we never forget our roots.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Trust in the Pond.</span>
				Trust is as important to us as a frog’s first hop. We
				promise to keep things clear and open — no murky waters
				here. That being said, if we see something that needs a
				little ribbit of improvement, we'll tell you. Trust goes
				both ways in any relationship, including ours!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Continuous Evolution.</span>
				Just like a tadpole transforms into a frog, we’re all about
				growth and change. We embrace every opportunity to evolve,
				learn, and improve, ensuring we stay fresh, innovative, and
				ready to take on any challenge.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Cultivate Long-Term Partnerships.</span>
				We’re not into fleeting frog jumps. Our aim is to build
				long-lasting relationships that grow over time, just like a
				pond’s ecosystem. Together, we’ll develop a deep
				understanding and make waves that last.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Do Good, Be Good.</span>
				We aim to prioritize relationships that share our commitment
				to making the world a better place, through sustainable
				practices and social impact initiatives. We're particular
				about the work we take on, because a thriving pond benefits
				every frog, fish, and friend within it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about__value">
			<p>
				<span>Excellence in Everything We Do.</span>
				We’re dedicated to hopping above and beyond. Our goal is to
				deliver work that exceeds expectations, reaching for the
				stars while keeping our feet firmly on the lily pads. At
				Tiny Pond, we’re all about making a splash.
